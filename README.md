# STAT167 Final Project
By: Shreya Mohan, Kalyani Mantirraju, Karen Alvarez, Crystal Arevalo, Mason Lam

## Project Motivation:
Understanding factors that contribute to flight delays is critical for informing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) policies and guiding airlines and airports in improving operational efficiency, enhancing weather preparedness, and reducing delays through controllable factors. By analyzing weather conditions, airline differences, holiday effects, fleet age, and airport specific challenges, this research can provide data-driven insights to optimize air travel and ensure compliance with aviation regulations in heavily congested areas like New York City. 

## Project Description:
The primary goal of this research is to explore factors influencing flight delays from New City airports in 2013.

## Packages & Datasets
nycflights13 package
flights, planes, airlines, airports and weather datasets

## Research Questions

1. **How do weather conditions affect flight delays?**  
   a. Are specific weather variables (e.g., precipitation, wind speed, humidity) correlated with departure and arrival delays?

2. **How do differences between airlines influence flight delays?**  
   a. Do certain airlines experience more delays than others? If so, what operational or fleet-related factors contribute to these differences?  
   b. How do metrics like cancellation rates and plane speed vary across airlines, and what impact do these metrics have on delays?

3. **Are delays more frequent during major holidays?**  
   a. Are there differences during peak travel periods (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Yearâ€™s Day)?

4. **Does the age of the plane affect flight delays?**  
   a. Do older planes experience more delays compared to newer ones?  
   b. Are there specific plane models or manufacturers associated with better on-time performance?

5. **How do environmental factors like humidity, visibility, and wind affect flight delays?**  
   a. Are these effects observed across all airports?
